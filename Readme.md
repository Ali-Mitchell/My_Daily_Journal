## Things I'd like to work on 
I would like to add a phone sized Media Query and a "clear User Input" button. I'd also like to make this applicable to a whole week. 

In the Javascript I felt like I used the same Function again and again in a way that wasn't the best use of my time. I'm hoping to find a way to get all the time-blocks to save in an object instead of multiple functions, would love feedback on how to do this. I also had a really hard time with getting Jquery to work for me. I am going to spend some more time on this.
